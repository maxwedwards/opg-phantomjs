# opg-phantomjs

This is a temporary holder for the phantomjs bz2 file that is used by opg-docker/casperjs.

The source for the file is https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/phantomjs-1.9.8-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2, but due to limits applied by bitbucket will result in occasional "403 Forbidden" errors and will break the image creation.

As such, we have a local copy here that is pulled down instead.
